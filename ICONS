To the developers:

List any icons you may need here. If missing, create a section for the
corresponding frontend and specifiy the filename for the image, the place
where it will be used and its purpose, and any other particular information,
such as the size, that may be handy.

To the artists:

All images should live inside the pixpmaps directory and have a standard
48x48 size, unless other size is specified. Also, it would be very useful to
get the layered XCF version of the images, so that others can composite new
icons out of the existing.


general purpose
===============

server.png - An icon representing a server, to composite with other icons
  and be able to represent things such as "Name resolution server". So it
  should not use the whole 48x48 grid.
passwd.png - An icon for dialogs that request passwords.


nameresolution-admin
====================

nameresolution_id.png - An icon for the machine's general information, such as hostname, domain,
  workgroup and description (identification tab).
	
nameresolution_alias.png - An icon for the alias section (/etc/hosts configurator).


users-admin
===========

users-group.png - An icon for the groups tab.
