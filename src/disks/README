Disks Admin Tool
----------------

The disks admin tool is a new tool for GNOME System Tool
that currently, 2003-12-22, isn't official.

So don't try to get support from the GNOME System Tool
developers. Please, ask directly to the tool developers.

Carlos García Campos <elkalmail@yahoo.es>

The tool isn't compiled and installed in a default 
configuration. You will need to:

1. Modify configure.in in the main directory to generate
the src/disks/Makefile

2. Add the disks directory to src/Makefile.am

3. Add disks.glade to interfaces/Makefile.am

4. Execute ./autogen.sh and compile all the GNOME System Tools
