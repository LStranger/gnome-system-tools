Disks Admin Tool
----------------

The disks admin tool is a new tool for GNOME System Tool
that currently, 2003-12-22, isn't official.

So don't try to get support from the GNOME System Tool
developers. Please, ask directly to the tool developers.

Carlos García Campos <elkalmail@yahoo.es>

The tool isn't compiled and installed in a default 
configuration. You will need to:

Run the autogen.sh script with --enable-disks parameter
