	* main.c (main): call transfer_logindefs_from_xml before creating
	the e-table because the e-table uses the logindefs to know which users
	to display. This was causing a bug in which only one user would be
	displayed.

	* transfer.c (transfer_logindefs_from_xml): make non-static
	* transfer.h (transfer_logindefs_from_xml): add to header
	* transfer.c (transfer_xml_to_gui): and remove from here.
	We only load the logindefs once.
