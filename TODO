    [X] backend support
    [ ] Bringing up a dialog in the fron end in which the user    
        can select the distro to use. Add a __HUGE__ warning about  
        the dangers of using this feature.                
[ ] If the tools look for file (read or write) and they can't find
    it the front end should pop up an error dialog.
[ ] Add a flag to the backends so that they will dump the files that
    they are going to use. This give the user the ability to back/review
    the files that are going to be read/written manually.
[ ] Time tool gets & sets time in the front end. Not the backend.
[ ] The tools should remember their last complexity state used.
[ ] The pixmaps inside de dialogs should be loaded with AA.
