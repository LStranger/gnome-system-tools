[~] Distro scanning
    [X] backend support
    [ ] Bringing up a dialog in the fron end in which the user    
        can select the distro to use. Add a __HUGE__ warning about  
        the dangers of using this feature.                
[ ] If the tools look for file (read or write) and they can't find
    it the front end should pop up an error dialog.
[ ] Add a flag to the backends so that they will dump the files that
    they are going to use. This give the user the ability to back/review
    the files that are going to be read/written manually.
[ ] Time tool gets & sets time in the front end. Not the backend.
[ ] The tools should remember their last complexity state used.
[ ] The pixmaps inside de dialogs should be loaded with AA.

Tambets
[~] Boot tool
    [X] The boot backend is not wrinting /etc/lilo.conf with changes
        (at least on my 2 RH systems 6.1 & 7.0 )
    [X] Clickin on the spin button (up/down) does not changes the apply
        button sensitivity.
    [X] The columns are too "tight" in advacend mode. Should we make the
        dialog wider ?
    [X] Add some spaces before the non cented cells.
    [X] Chaning from adv. to simple mode several times maked the dialog
        crash.
    [X] The front end does not show the default boot entry.
    [ ] The add button in "this kernel requires aditional parameters" is not
        implemented.
    [X] When switching complexity mode, the buttons should not be spaced.
        when swithcing from adv. to simple mode, we need to "pack" the buttons again.
    [X] After clicking apply, two report dialogs come up.
    [X] If we have a default button (in advanced mode) the settings dialog
        should not contain "Make this my default boot" this is giving the
        user two choices for acomplishing the same task, which I think can
        confuse users.

[ ] - Not completed
[X] - Done
[~] - Partially completed (must be divide in tasks so that
      we know what has been done and what hasn't. So a task
