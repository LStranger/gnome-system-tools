[ ] Disks admin redesign
[ ] Shares gui redesign
 
Boc

[ ] The tools are currently not working on the control-center

Arturo

[ ] Internet connection druid
[ ] The networking tool takes like 1 min. to load. It blocks when the
    "found wvdialconf" text is dispayed. (on RedHat 7.0)
[ ] The backend should verify that the data passed to it makes sense.
    Stuff like   DNS servers need to be in the format of [0-255].[0-255].
    [0-255].[0-255] etc.
    The backend should exit with an error which is displayed in a dialog to the
    user.
[ ] We need to encode the text before generating XML.
    This is the output of running network-admin :
    http://www.gnome.org/~chema/output.txt
    http://www.gnome.org/~chema/wvdial.conf
    We need to pass all the text that we are going to output thru a common
    function that encodes the XML text.
[ ] If I run a backend with "--help" as a normal user, don't ask for the
    root password.
[ ] Fix the "connections" (interfaces) page in the front end.
    - The network interfaces appear to be inactive in the front end.
    Fix the problem, which might be on the front end or the backend.
    - The ethernet conections apear as DHCP even when they have static IP's
    - All the ehternet interfaces that are added, are "eth0" instead of
    "eth[x]"
    - I don't think ADD works correctly.
[ ] network tool : The front end should verify the ip addresses before
    pushing XML to the backend.
[ ] The dns servers text entry does not set the apply button sensitivity when
    text is beeing typed. When text is beeing deleted it does.
[ ] The add button button sensitity in the hosts tab is behaving non-intuitive
    it shoud be active as soon as there is some text in either the ip address
    or aliases text box. If the add button is clicked and we are missing one
    of the fields, we disaplay an error message in a dialog to let the user
    know why can't that host be added.

[~] Distro scanning
    [X] backend support
    [ ] Bringing up a dialog in the fron end in which the user    
        can select the distro to use. Add a __HUGE__ warning about  
        the dangers of using this feature.                
[ ] If the tools look for file (read or write) and they can't find
    it the front end should pop up an error dialog.
[ ] Add a flag to the backends so that they will dump the files that
    they are going to use. This give the user the ability to back/review
    the files that are going to be read/written manually.
[ ] Time tool gets & sets time in the front end. Not the backend.
[ ] The tools should remember their last complexity state used.
[ ] The pixmaps inside de dialogs should be loaded with AA.

(boot)
    [X] The boot backend is not wrinting /etc/lilo.conf with changes
        (at least on my 2 RH systems 6.1 & 7.0 )
    [X] Clickin on the spin button (up/down) does not changes the apply
        button sensitivity.
    [X] The columns are too "tight" in advacend mode. Should we make the
        dialog wider ?
    [X] Add some spaces before the non cented cells.
    [X] Chaning from adv. to simple mode several times maked the dialog
        crash.
    [X] The front end does not show the default boot entry.
    [ ] The add button in "this kernel requires aditional parameters" is not
        implemented.
    [X] When switching complexity mode, the buttons should not be spaced.
        when swithcing from adv. to simple mode, we need to "pack" the buttons
	    again.
    [X] After clicking apply, two report dialogs come up.
    [X] If we have a default button (in advanced mode) the settings dialog
        should not contain "Make this my default boot" this is giving the
        user two choices for acomplishing the same task, which I think can
        confuse users.
(users)	   
    [ ] Switching modes should keep the seleced user selected.
    [ ] Hide the NIS tab of the notebook until we have backend support for
         this.
    [ ] The users data and the group data are not kept in sync in the front end.
        If I change the group of user "a" to "foo". The "foo" group is not
        updated with  the new user  "a". We need to verify before writing to
        the backend that the user  data and the group data is in sync. We also
        need to verify that we get from the  backend user&group data that is in
        sync, if we found a problem (for example user  "a" has group as "foo"
        but group "foo" does not contain user "a") we warn the user that there
        was a problem found on the system configuration but that it has been
        fixed. The backend also needs to verify that the users & group
        information it is writing is in sync.

Legend

[ ] - Not completed
[X] - Done
[~] - Partially completed (must be divide in tasks so that
      we know what has been done and what hasn't. So a task
	 with childs that have both done and unfinished tasks
	 is partially done)
