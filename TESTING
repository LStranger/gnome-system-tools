This text file describes procedures for testing the GSTs. They're the
procedures we use ourselves to test the tools, and they're suggested as a
starting point for people porting the tools to other platforms.


Network
=======

1)  Start the tool as a normal user, and enter the root password at the
    prompt. Wait for the scanning system configuration dialog to disappear.

2)  Examine the General tab. Check that the hostname is correct.

3)  Enable windows networking, if it's not already enabled, and apply.

4)  Run smbclient -L hostname on the command line, confirm that the host shows
    up under the "Server" header, with the comment listed in the Description:
    field in network-admin as the comment.

5)  Disable windows networking, and apply.

6)  Run smbclient -L hostname on the command line again, verify that the
    server does not show up anymore.

7)  Go to the Connections tab. Run ifconfig on the command line, examine each
    interface on the list, making sure it shows up in the list in
    network-admin, and that the settings are correct. Note that PPP interfaces
    may not show up if they're not currently active.

8)  Deactivate an interface and apply. Verify that the interface does not show
    up/shows up as disabled in the ifconfig output.

9)  Reactivate the interface and apply. Verify that it shows up as correctly
    configured and enabled in the ifconfig output, and that no other
    interfaces are changed.

10) Select an interface and click Configure... Change the comment of the
    interface, close the dialog, and apply. Verify that the comment is
    changed in the OS' interfaces file (/etc/network/interfaces on Debian,
    for instance).

11) Configure an interface to use DHCP. If you have a DHCP server, verify
    that the interface is brought down and back up and gets an IP from the
    DHCP server, by running ifconfig and checking the settings.

12) Verify that the fact that the interface should use DHCP has been properly
    written to the system's config files.

13) Set the interface to use a static IP address, subnet mask, and gateway
    address. Apply, and verify with ifconfig and by reading the system
    configuration files.

14) Go to the DNS tab. cat /etc/resolv.conf, and verify that the two match.

15) Change the DNS server to a bogus IP number, and apply. Verify that it's
    written to /etc/resolv.conf.

16) Change the DNS server back to the correct settings, apply, and verify.
    Then add "ximian.com" to Search Domains, apply, and confirm that
    "host www.ximian.com" and "host www" give the same output.

17) Go to the Hosts tab. Verify that the list matches what's in /etc/hosts.

18) Add an alias, and verify it's written to /etc/hosts. Then use the host
    command to look up the alias, verifying that it can be looked up
    correctly.

19) Quit the tool, and then manually ifdown/ifup each interface on the
    machine in turn (for systems that have ifup/ifdown), verifying that there
    are no errors, and then run ifconfig to verify that everything is up.


Users
=====

1)  Start users-admin as a normal user, and enter the root password in the
    dialog. Wait for the scanning system configuration dialog to close.

2)  Assure you are in simple mode (the button at the bottom of the window
    should read "More Options >>". If not, click the button labelled "<<
    Fewer Options").

3)  Click "Add user...". The User Creation Druid will show up, with an intro
    screen. Go through the procedure of adding a user named test, with the
    comment "Test user". On the Password options tab, set the password to
    "1" in both entries, make sure "Check password quality" is selected, and
    click next. The tool should prevent you from continuing, saying the
    password is too short. Change the password to something better, and click
    next. Click finish to create the user.

4)  Make sure the user is now on the list. Click apply, then check
    /etc/passwd to verify that the user has been added with the expected
    settings.

5)  As a normal user, do an "su - test", and enter test's password. Make sure
    it's possible to log in, read the home directory, etc.

6)  Click on "Settings" for the user test, and change the full name and
    password to something else. Apply, then verify /etc/passwd and by logging
    in with the new password.

7)  Click on the "More Options >>" button. The user interface changes to have
    a "Groups" tab, and adds a search bar along the top of the list of users.

8)  Enter "test" in the search bar, and press enter. The users list should
    only show the newly added test user.

10) Change to the Groups tab, and add a group named testgroup. Apply changes.

11) Read /etc/group and verify that the group testgroup has been added.

12) Go back to the Users tab. Select the test user, and click Settings. Go to
    the Groups tab of the User Account Editor dialog, and add testgroup to
    the user's groups. Click ok, and then apply. Verify that the user has
    been added to the testgroup group by logging in as the user and running
    "groups".

13) Click on the "Profiles" button. The Profile editor pops up.

14) Select the default profile, and click Copy. Name the new profile Test.

15) Go to the System tab of the Profile editor, and select the Test profile
    for editing. Change the home directory to /home/test/$user, and the
    default shell to /bin/sh.

16) Apply and close the Profiles editor. Click add user (note that it no
    longer uses a Druid, since it's in advanced mode), and add a new user
    named test2, using the Test profile, then apply.

17) Verify that the user has been added in /etc/passwd, then log in as the
    user, making sure that the home directory exists.

18) Delete the user test2, Apply, and make sure that the user has been
    removed properly. 

19) Remove the group testgroup, Apply, and make sure the group has been
    removed properly.

20) Remove the user test.


Time
====

1)  Start time-admin as a normal user, enter the root password in the dialog,
    and wait for the scanning your system configuration dialog to disappear.

2)  Verify that the time, date, and timezone is correct, by comparing it to
    the output of the date command, run on the command line.

3)  Change the time and date to one day and one hour ahead, and apply. Verify
    that the date command agrees.

4)  Change the time and date back, apply, and verify.

5)  Click the "Set time zone" button, and select a location in a very
    different time zone. Close the time zone dialog, and apply. Verify that
    the time, date, and time zone are the same in time-admin and in the
    output from date.

6)  Change the time zone back to the correct one, and apply again, then
    verify.

7)  Enable "Keep clock synchronized with selected servers", and click "Select
    servers". Select a couple of servers close to you, close the server
    selection dialog, and then apply. Check that the settings are adequately
    reflected in /etc/ntp.conf.


Shares
======

Note: Testing shares properly requires a second machine, preferably one that
already has working Samba and NFS shares set up, so it's possible to test
actual sharing.

1)  Start shares-admin as a normal user, enter the root password in the
    dialog, and wait for the scanning your system configuration dialog to
		disappear.

2)  Change to the exports tab, and look at the list of exports (if any
    exists). On the command line, run smbclient -L <hostname> and verify that
    the list of shares corresponds to the list in shares-admin.

3)  Click the Add... button. Use type: Samba, and give the export a name and
    comment, and point it at an existing directory. Set it to browseable and
    public, click ok, and click Apply.

4)  Run smbclient -L <hostname> again and verify that the new share you added
    shows up on the list.

5)  On another machine, use smbmount to mount the share you just created.
    Verify that it can be read, but not written to.

6)  Change the settings of the newly added share to writable, and apply.
    Remount the share on the other machine if necessary, then verify that the
    share can be written to.

7)  Switch to the Imports tab. Click add, and enter the information for a
    samba share from the other machine. Mount it on an existing mountpoint.
    Make sure "mounted" and "Do not remount this share after computer
    reboots" are checked. Click ok, and apply. Verify that the share is
    actually mounted at the mountpoint you specified.

8)  Change the settings of the import to uncheck "Do not remount this share
    after computer reboots", and apply. Verify that the import is still
    mounted, then check /etc/fstab to verify that the settings seem sane. On
    the commandline, do umount <mountpoint> and then mount <mountpoint>, and
    verify that the import is still mounted.

9)  Repeat above procedures, but for NFS shares.

10) Delete the added shares, and verify that they are no longer listed (use
    smbclient -L <hostname> for Samba shares).
