This text file describes procedures for testing the XSTs. They're the
procedures we use ourselves to test the tools, and they're suggested as a
starting point for people porting the tools to other platforms.


Network
=======

1)  Start the tool as a normal user, and enter the root password at the
    prompt. Wait for the scanning system configuration dialog to disappear.

2)  Examine the General tab. Check that the hostname is correct.

3)  Enable windows networking, if it's not already enabled, and apply.

4)  Run smbclient -L hostname on the command line, confirm that the host shows
    up under the "Server" header, with the comment listed in the Description:
    field in network-admin as the comment.

5)  Disable windows networking, and apply.

6)  Run smbclient -L hostname on the command line again, verify that the
    server does not show up anymore.

7)  Go to the Connections tab. Run ifconfig on the command line, examine each
    interface on the list, making sure it shows up in the list in
    network-admin, and that the settings are correct. Note that PPP interfaces
    may not show up if they're not currently active.

8)  Deactivate an interface and apply. Verify that the interface does not show
    up/shows up as disabled in the ifconfig output.

9)  Reactivate the interface and apply. Verify that it shows up as correctly
    configured and enabled in the ifconfig output, and that no other
    interfaces are changed.

10) Select an interface and click Configure... Change the comment of the
    interface, close the dialog, and apply. Verify that the comment is
    changed in the OS' interfaces file (/etc/network/interfaces on Debian,
    for instance).

11) Configure an interface to use DHCP. If you have a DHCP server, verify
    that the interface is brought down and back up and gets an IP from the
    DHCP server, by running ifconfig and checking the settings.

12) Verify that the fact that the interface should use DHCP has been properly
    written to the system's config files.

13) Set the interface to use a static IP address, subnet mask, and gateway
    address. Apply, and verify with ifconfig and by reading the system
    configuration files.

14) Go to the DNS tab. cat /etc/resolv.conf, and verify that the two match.

15) Change the DNS server to a bogus IP number, and apply. Verify that it's
    written to /etc/resolv.conf.

16) Change the DNS server back to the correct settings, apply, and verify.
    Then add "ximian.com" to Search Domains, apply, and confirm that
    "host www.ximian.com" and "host www" give the same output.

17) Go to the Hosts tab. Verify that the list matches what's in /etc/hosts.

18) Add an alias, and verify it's written to /etc/hosts. Then use the host
    command to look up the alias, verifying that it can be looked up
    correctly.

19) Quit the tool, and then manually ifdown/ifup each interface on the
    machine in turn (for systems that have ifup/ifdown), verifying that there
    are no errors, and then run ifconfig to verify that everything is up.
