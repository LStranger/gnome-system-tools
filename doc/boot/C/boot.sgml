    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      Linux uses the <application>LILO</application> bootloader to start your
      system.  This lets you choose whether you want to boot into Linux, any
      Unix, Windows, or even OS/2 if you so desire.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="editing-entry">
    <title>Editing an Entry</title>
    <para>
      The Boot Manager has each operating system as an entry.  To edit an entry,
      simply click the entry you wish to edit, and hit
      <guibutton>Settings</guibutton>.  This window lets you set the name of the
      partition, and the boot type.  The name is what you refer to the entry as
      when you boot up the computer.  The boot type specifies to Ximian Setup
      Tools what the operating system to start up is.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="default">
    <title>What is Default?</title>
    <para>
      The default option specifies which entry will be the default to boot up if
      you don't answer which to boot in time.  The time that you have to specify
      which to boot is shown in the bottom part of the main window in the
      <guilabel>Starting your computer</guilabel>.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="advanced">
    <title>Advanced Options</title>
    <para>
      The Boot Manager program gives advanced users more options to use while
      configuring their boot manager.

    <para>
      To enable the advanced section, click on the <guibutton>More
      Options</guibutton> button on the bottom of the main Boot Manager window.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="advanced-adding">
      <title>Adding Entries</title>
      <para>
	To add a new entry to the listings, click the <guibutton>Add</guibutton>
	button in the main window.  A druid will show up giving you help with
	creating a new entry.
      </para>
      <para>
	The first screen on the druid is a simple introduction message.  Click
	<guibutton>Next</guibutton> to begin your configuration.  Enter the name
	and the boot types into their respective fields.  Then you'll need to
	select your device on the next screen.  The device is what partition
	your image file exists on.  That is all there is to it!
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="advanced-deleting">
      <title>Deleting Entries</title>
      <para>
	Deleting entries is easy.  You simply select the entry and press the
	<guibutton>Delete</guibutton> button.
	<warning>
	  <para>
	    Deleting entries can render your system unable to bootup.  Make sure
	    you have a bootdisk handy when deleting entries.
