    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      The networking tool lets you specify how your computer connects
      to a network. You can start and stop network connections, as
      well as set the name and address for your computer.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="starting">
      <title>Starting your Network</title>
      <para>
        This section will tell you about the basic information your
        computer needs to connect to a network.  Just type the
        information into the appropriate boxes in the Networking Tool.
      </para>
    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
	  <term>Interface</term>
	  <listitem>
      <para>
        First, you will select the primary hardware interface your
        your computer will use to connect to the local network. In
        most cases, this will be the only interface you will need, and
        you won't have to know anything more than its name.
      </para>
      <para>
        For most Linux systems, your primary interface will be
        <systemitem>eth0</systemitem>, and for Solaris systems, it
        will probably be <systemitem>hma0</systemitem>. If you have
        multiple interfaces, you will need more advanced tools than
        are available here.
       </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>IP Address</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
         Next, your computer needs to get an IP address. This is the
         unique address that identifies your computer on the
         network. There are three ways that your computer can get this
         information. If you do not know which method your network
         uses, or what your IP address should be, ask your system
         administrator.
         <itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para>
             You can enter the information manually.
            </para> </listitem>
 
           <listitem><para>
             The address can be assigned by a DCHP server.
            </para> </listitem>

           <listitem><para>
             The address can be assigned by a BootP server.
            </para> </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
     </para>
      <para>
       If you're entering the IP address by hand, make sure no one is
       using this IP number already.
     </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Netmask</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
              Next, you need a netmask.  The netmask tells your
              computer which part of the IP number is static
              (i.e. equal for all computers on the network), where the
              remainder varies on a per-computer basis. A
              rule-of-thumb is that 255 in one of the fields means
              that this part of the IP is totally static, and 0 means
              it is totally dynamic. A common netmask is
              "255.255.255.0".
           </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Gateway</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
       If your local network is connected to other networks, like the
       Internet, chances are you'll have a gateway. A gateway is a
       computer that relays information back and forth to other
       networks with other netmasks and IP ranges. Like any computer
       on the local network, the gateway also has an IP address. Enter
       it in the corresponding fields if you want to communicate with
       other networks.
         </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
     </variablelist>
    
     <para>
        That should be all the information you need to enter to start
        your network connection.
     </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="behavior">
      <title>Customizing Network Behavior</title>
      <para>
       You can tell your computer to enable networking (with the
       configuration you provide) every time it starts up. If your
       computer is a networked workstation, you'll generally want
       this.
