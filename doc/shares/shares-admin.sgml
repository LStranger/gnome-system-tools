    <title>The Shares Setup Tool</title>
    <para>The shares setup tool lets you configure your shared network files and
directories. You can import files from another computer on the network, as
well as export your files using one of two methods.</para>
  </preface>
  <chapter id=importing>
    <title>Importing files</title>
    <para>The "imports" tab produces a tree of known network
resources, sorted by the apparent computers exporting these.</para>
    <para>Clicking a folder allows you to decide whether your computer
should remember it for the future, and if this share should be
mounted.</para>
    <para>When mounting a share, you also have to specify a mount point -
that is, where in your computer's file system you'd like the files to appear.
If the cell providing the mount point for this share is empty, or if it
reflects a different directory from what you prefer, click the "settings"
button to make changes.</para>
    <para>The settings dialog also enables you to change other parameters;
what type of sharing protocol is used (you should generally leave this
alone, unless you're adding a share which is not already in the list), which
host is providing it (ditto), and what the exporting host calls the share
(ditto, do not change unless you know what you're doing). At the very bottom
of the dialog is the mount point specification. Clicking "browse" lets you
choose a directory, and create a new one if needed. Note that it is
customary to mount shares as "/mnt/sharename/" on Unix, but you can in
theory mount it almost anywhere. It is a good idea <emphasis>not</emphasis> to mount it in a
directory already containing files, though.</para>
    <para>Some shares require you to provide a username and/or password.
These can be entered in their respective fields. Note that the NFS protocol
generally doesn't support this, so they are turned off for such shares.</para>
    <para>If the share you'd like to import is not in the list, you'll have
to create a new one. This is done with the "new import" button, requiring
you to fill in an import dialog from scratch.</para>

  <chapter id=exporting>
    <title>Exporting files</title>
    <para>There are two protocols by which you can export files: SMB and
NFS. The former is the protocol employed by typical Windows(R) computers,
and the latter is more common in the Unix world. Since the options available
when employing either of these methods are very different, they have a tab
each.</para>
    <simplesect>
      <title>SMB</title>
      <para>SMB shares have a number of options: Browseable, which allows
others to see the share when browsing from other machines (if this is off,
the share will be invisible, but users that know about it can still access
it), public, which means that anyone has access to the share (if this is
off, the user must have an account and password on your computer), and
writable, specifying that users that can access this share can also write to
it or delete files.</para>
    </simplesect>
    <simplesect>
      <title>NFS</title>
      <para>Each NFS share has a list of "client patterns", specifying
computers that are allowed to access it. In theory, anyone using these
machines can have access to the share.</para>
      <para>A pattern can be an IP address (e.g. 10.10.10.5) or a DNS record
(e.g. justice.copyleft.no). You can also use stars ('*') in the pattern,
specifying that anything goes in place of the star. Stars do not match
punctuations. Thus, the pattern "10.10.10.*" would allow access from
"10.10.10.40" and "10.10.10.5", but not "10.10.11.40". Likewise,
"*.copyleft.no" would match "wrath.copyleft.no", but not
"petri.dish.copyleft.no" or "wrath.copyright.no". Remember that when using
DNS names, you should use the authoritative name for the computer(s), e.g.
what is returned by an nslookup on its IP address.</para>
