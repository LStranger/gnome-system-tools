1  Printcap
-----------

The system printcap, reflecting its "printing capabilities", resides in /etc/printcap. Its format is
modeled after that of /etc/termcap - i.e. it's fairly hard to read. When you're looking for configured
printers, or want to add/remove printers, this is the place to start.

Simplified for our uses, the format goes as indicated below. Note that angle brackets <> are used here to
indicate option classes, and are not part of the format.

<printername>|<alias>|<alias>:sd=<spooldir>:lp=<device>:if=<filter>:mx#<maxjobsizeinK>:sh:
<printername>|<alias>|<alias>:sd=<spooldir>:lp=<device>:if=<filter>:mx#<maxjobsizeinK>:sh:
...

"sh" here is a boolean option whose presence means "suppress headers". This prevents any banner pages
from being printed with each job, and is generally a good thing to be able to specify. An example from
the real world:

lp:sd=/var/spool/lpd/lp:mx#0:sh:lp=/dev/lp0:if=/var/spool/lpd/lp/filter:

The printcap(5) manpage has more details about the formatting of this file.

2  Filters
----------

Different distributions handle magic filtering of print files differently. A magic filter determines
the type of file being printed, and converts it, sometimes through several steps, to printer-specific
output. Ghostscript is a traditional step in this pipeline, if you're printing graphics to a
non-postscript printer.

2.1  Red Hat
------------

Red Hat 7.0 has a master filter, which resides in /usr/lib/rhs/rhs-printfilters/master-filter. This
filter is linked from the printer's spool directory. For each configured printer, there is a number of
configuration files that affect the operation of the filter. Note that the variables defined in these
files sometimes have the keyword "export" in front of them. We need to handle this gracefully.

2.1.1  /var/spool/lpd/<printer>/general.cfg
-------------------------------------------

This file holds the following options (with example values set):

DESIRED_TO=ps       Dunno. I think this is always set to ps.

PAPERSIZE=letter    The paper size identifier.

PRINTER_TYPE=LOCAL  Dunno if this is used by anything other than the frontend.

ASCII_TO_PS=YES     If we should convert ASCII files to PS before printing. Setting the PrintTool
                    option "Fast text printing (non-PS printers only)" to YES sets this to NO.

2.1.2  /var/spool/lpd/<printer>/postscript.cfg
----------------------------------------------

This file holds the following options (with example values set):

GSDEVICE=uniprint   Ghostscript device to use when converting from Postscript to native printer output.
                    Examples are uniprint and cdj890 (HP DeskJet 890). Passed to Ghostscript as
                    -sDEVICE=<device>.

RESOLUTION=NAxNA    Resolution to print at. This is usually <Xdpi>x<Ydpi>, but can also be NAxNA for
                    printers that don't allow this setting.

COLOR=stcany        Colour depth/print mode. Can be empty.

PAPERSIZE=letter    Papersize when printing PS? Why is this duplicated here?

EXTRA_GS_OPTIONS="" Extra options to pass to Ghostscript.

REVERSE_ORDER=      This doesn't seem to have a corresponding option in PrintTool. I wonder if it
                    does anything.

PS_SEND_EOF=NO      Some printers need an EOF to eject the page when the job is finished. Setting
                    this to YES accomplished this.

NUP=1               Number of pages to print per output page. Uses 'mpage' to format the output.
                    Use 8, 4, 2 or 1.

RTLFTMAR=18         Left/right margins, in 1/72 of an inch units.

TOPBOTMAR=18        Top/bottom margins, in 1/72 of an inch units.

2.1.3  /var/spool/lpd/<printer>/textonly.cfg
--------------------------------------------

This file holds the following options (with example values set):

TEXTONLYOPTIONS=    Dunno.

CRLFTRANS=          Set to 1 if you want to "fix stair-stepping text", as the PrintTool puts it.

TEXT_SEND_EOF=NO    Some printers need an EOF to eject the page when the job is finished. Setting
                    this to YES accomplishes this. I think this option is linked directly to the
                    PS_SEND_EOF option in PrintTool, i.e. they're always the same.

2.2  Potato

3  Spoolers

3.1  LPRng
----------

Red Hat uses LPRng by default, but you can get RPMs for CUPS as well. CUPS and LPRng are mutually
exclusive, as both install similar binaries related to queue control.

3.2  CUPS
---------

Might be a default on some systems.

4  Printer Drivers
------------------

Traditionally, printer drivers reside in the Ghostscript package. Extensions to the Ghostscript
driver database are available through the Omni package (which needs you to patch Ghostscript), and
probably from other places as well. Use the following command to query the installed Ghostscript
drivers:

echo "devicenames ==" | gs -q -dNODISPLAY -

This will only list the names of the available drivers. I don't think it's possible to query
individual drivers (GS knows a lot about them, but won't tell) - hence metadata has to be provided
separately. See the next section for how this is done in Red Hat.

4.1  Red Hat
------------

Red Hat has a printer metadatabase for their native (and aging) PrintTool. This database is in
/usr/lib/rhs/rhs-printfilters/printerdb. The format for this file is described within the file
itself. This file is _only_ used in the interface, presenting the user with options to choose
from when configuring a printer. The selected options are then written to the .cfg files (see
sections [2.1.1-2.1.3]). So, this file is irrelevant after the printer is configured.

Apart from this, Red Hat doesn't seem to have a concept of printer drivers.


5 Postscript Printing
---------------------

We are going to use PPD files for printing to ghostscript printers. In the non-gnome-print case
we might use ppdfilt from our friends at VA.
[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3800&release_id=22012]

ppdfilt takes as input a Postcript File, a ppd file and a set of selected options, it then merges
the input Postcript and generates a Printer Specific Postscript containing all the commands to
set the selected options.

For gnome-print, we will import the PPD files and convert them first to our own XML format and
write the XML for gnome-print to use. The postscript driver will talk to libppd so that libppd
can add the postcript commands to the page.
