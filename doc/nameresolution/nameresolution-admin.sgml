    <title>The Name Resolution Setup Tool</title>
    <para>
The name resolution tool lets you decide how network names are looked up. It
lets you set the name for your own computer, its Internet domain, Windows(R)
workgroup, etc. 
    </para>
  </preface>
  <chapter id=identification>
    <title>Identification</title>
    <para>The "identification" tab lets you describe your computer in terms
of name, Internet domain, Windows(R) workgroup and a description which is
shown to others browsing the local network.</para>
    <para>There are also two text displays showing the reverse equivalents
of your computer name and Internet domain. These cannot be edited, but
serve as guides - it's what others will see when trying to look up the
Internet name information from your computer, and can only be changed in the
DNS (you don't need to worry about this).</para>
  </chapter>

    <title>DNS Servers</title>
    <para>This tab shows a list of the Internet name servers that will be used
to answer name queries. They are tried in order of appearance, and are
specified by IP address.</para>
  </chapter>
  <chapter id=wins>
    <title>WINS Resolution</title>
    <para>You are allowed to specify a WINS server, which will be used to get
the list of computers participating in Windows(R)-like networking (SMB). You
do not need to specify this unless your network is complex, typically
consisting of two or more bridged networks.</para>
  </chapter>
  <chapter id=searchdomains>
    <title>Search Domains</title>
    <para>This is a list of Internet domains which will be appended to an
unqualified host name, in order, when determining its IP address. Typically
you will enter your Internet domain here, if you have one, and any other
Internet domains for which you want to be able to use hostname
shorthand.</para>
    <para>E.g. if you have "mydomain.net" and "otherdomain.com" in your
searchlist, and enter "ghost" as a hostname (in your web browser, for
example), your computer will look for "ghost.mydomain.net", followed by
"ghost.otherdomain.com" if the former doesn't exist.</para>
  </chapter>
  <chapter id=staticnames>
    <title>Static Names</title>
    <para>Some computers don't have a DNS entry, that is, there is no DNS
server that give it an Internet name. You'd normally have to refer to such
computers by their IP address.</para>
    <para>However, this list lets you enter name aliases for such hosts. It
works like a private name server - aliases entered here will map to their
corresponding IP addresses whenever they are used. For instance, entering
the alias "cube" for the IP address "10.10.10.1" will let you use "cube" in
your applications when referring to the computer with this IP.</para>
    <para>You can have several aliases for one IP. Use spaces to separate
them in the alias entry field.</para>
    <para>Remember that the aliases will only work on your local computer.
Others will have to add similar aliases on their computers if they want to
use them.</para>
    <para>You'll usually have a special IP address here - "127.0.0.1". This
is a reference to your computer, from your computer. It is also called the
"loopback address".</para>
