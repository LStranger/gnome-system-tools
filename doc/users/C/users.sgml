    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      Each person who uses a Linux/Unix system has the ability to be given a
      user.  The user account allows them to configure their own preferences,
      secure their private work from others, and even let them have their
      desktop look entirely different from the person using the same computer on
      another user account.  This however isn't a very easy task to do for an
      administrator with lots of users.  The Users and Groups tool in Ximian
      Setup Tools strives to make this experience easier for administrators.

    <title>Basic Mode</title>
    <sect2 id="basic-new">
      <para>
	Using basic mode to add users gives you an advantage of having a druid
	help you through the creation process.  This is especially useful if you
	are creating an account for your first time.  However, if you're more
	experienced, you may wish to use the advanced setup.
      </para>
      <para>
	You can start by clicking <guibutton>Add User</guibutton>.  This will
	present you with a druid.  After you hit <guibutton>Next</guibutton>,
	you will need to enter the persons username.  This may be virtually
	anything you want.  It is recommended that you make it easy to type. 
	You can also enter the user's real name, office location that they work
	at, work phone number, and home phone number.  Those are optional
	properties though.
      </para>
      <para>
	The second screen has the password setup.  You will need to enter the
	password twice to confirm that there weren't any typos.  You may also
	choose to <guilabel>Check password quality</guilabel>.  This will check
	for length and how random of a word it is.
      </para>
      <para>
	The last screen simply tells you that you have completed the process of
	adding a user.  Press <guibutton>Finish</guibutton> to complete your
	process.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="basic-editing">
      <title>Editing Users</title>
      <para>
	Not only can Ximian Setup Tools add users, but it can also configure a
	users account, even after it has been added.  To do this, select your
	user and click <guibutton>Settings</guibutton>.
      </para>
      <para>
	In this, you can edit their username, personal information, or even
	change their password.  As when creating an account, the personal
	information is optional.  The only mandatory parts of this screen is the
	username and the password.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="basic-delete">
      <title>Deleting Users</title>
      <para>
	Deleting users is easy.  All you do is select the user you wish to
	delete, and press the <guibutton>Delete</guibutton> at right.
      </para>
      <tip>
	<title>Lots of old users?</title>
	<para>
	  Do you need to delete multiple users.  Just hold the ctrl button while
	  you click on each users name.  This will let you delete all the users
	  in one swipe.  If you need to delete multiple users that are adjacent
	  in the list, hold shift and click on the first and last user you want
	  to delete.  This will select those two and everything inbetween.
	</para>
      </tip>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="advanced">
    <title>Advanced Options</title>
    <para>
      The advanced options are only for those users who are experienced enough
      to deal with creating users without a druid and for managing groups.  If
      you aren't confident in using the advanced mode, you should probably drop
      back to the basic mode by clicking on <guibutton>Fewer
      Options</guibutton>.
    </para>
    <sect2 id="advanced-add">
      <title>Adding Users</title>
      <para>
	By pressing the <guibutton>Add user</guibutton> you open up a window.
	The only mandatory information is the username.  Profiles <!-- link to
	profiles section later --> are templates for creating users out of.  For
	more information on profiles, refer to the profiles section.
      </para>
      <para>
	The <guilabel>Groups</guilabel> tab lets you configure your groups.
	Groups allow you to configure users with similar permissions.
      </para>
      <example id="groups-ex">
	<title>Groups</title>
	<para>
	  A company keeps all their accounting information in one file.  They want
	  the accounting people to have access to this file, but they don't want
	  the marketing department to be able to read it.  They would create a
	  group called 'accounting' assign permissions based on that.
	</para>
      </example>
      <para>
	For more information on groups, refer to the chgrp, group, or chmod man
	pages.
      </para>
      <para>
	The <guilabel>Password</guilabel> tab has options for your passwords
	such as how a password is created, setting the password manually, and
	password expiration.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="profiles">
      <title>Profiles</title>
      <para>
	Profiles are meant to make creating similar users easier.  They allow
	properties which will be static from user to user to be preset in the
	new users with the profile.  You can control the system defaults such as
	home directory and shell, automatic UID/GID (User ID/Group ID)
	generation, and password experation information.
      </para>
      <example id="profile-ex">
	<title>Profiles</title>
	<para>
	  A company has an accounting department, and they just hired 50 new
	  employees.  They want all the new users to have the same group, their
	  home directory to be in /home/accounting/$user, and have their password
	  expire after 30 days.  They would create a profile that specified this.
	  When the administrator creates these users, he just needs to specify
	  that they all apply to the accounting profile.  The desired properties
	  of each user is preset.
