The GNOME System Tools version 0.32.0 "99% fat free" have been released.

The GNOME System Tools are a set of cross-platform configuration utilities for Linux and other Unix systems. Internally they are divided in frontends and backends. The frontend knows nothing about the underlying system and provides the same user interface across the different types of systems. The backend knows how to read and write the configuration information. The GNOME System Tools do not impose a new database on the system: they work with the default configuration files so that configuration can still be done by hand or by other tools.

Downloading

Help Wanted
===========
We still need lots of help from anybody interested in contributing to GST, even if it's only an email letting us know whether the tools worked for your system. You can also submit bug reports at http://bugzilla.gnome.org

Testing
-------
Testing that the tools work correctly on your system and either filing detailed bug reports or confirming that they work correctly is greatly appreciated. If you test a tool on an unsupported distro/system and find out that it works correctly, please let us know so that we can update the supported tools matrix (see below).

Porting
-------
The backends are designed as to minimize the effort needed to support more distros/systems. A great way to contribute is to port the tools to another distribution/system.

Adding services descriptions to the services-admin tool
-------------------------------------------------------
In order to make the services-admin tool more user-friendly, there are a lot of services that need descriptions for what they do

Prerequisites
=============

* GNOME 2 libraries

* GConf

* LibGlade

Stability
=========
The tools have been stable on our systems recently. However, since this tools modify your system configuration we suggest that only people which are going to be able to solve a problem if something goes wrong use them at the time. We have created a backup system so that the changes made to the configuration files are tracked and stored.

Mailing list / IRC
==================
For discussion and feedback, sign up for our mailing list:http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/setup-tool-hackers

You can also find us in the #gst channel on IRC server irc.gnome.org

Whitepaper
==========
You can find the latest version of the GST whitepaper at: http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/helix-setup-tools.html

Backup system
=============
Every time a tool modifies your system configuration files, it makes backups of those files. The backups are rotated (for 9 levels in total), and the backup made the first time the tool was run is kept forever. This means that you can revert your system configuration to the point before you ever ran a GNOME System Tool.

The backup path is /var/cache/setup-tools-backends/backup/<tool>/<id>/. In this directory, you'll find a complete snapshot of the files that were modified. The original directory structure leading up to these files is also kept. <id> runs from 1-9, and when the first backup is rotated out, it is kept in a special catalog called "First", which is never touched again.

Current Tool Set
================
- Services admin
Allows you to configure:
    * the services your computer will run at startup
    * in which runlevels do they run

- Network admin
Allows you to configure your:

    * hostname
    * samba hostname and workgroup
    * DNS servers
    * search domains
    * hosts (/etc/hosts)
    * Network interfaces
    * ppp
    * ethernet
    * slip
    * wireless

- Time admin
Allows you to configure your:

    * Date & Time
    * Timezone
    * NTPD servers

- Users admin
Allows you to manage:

    * Users
    * username / full name
    * password
    * home dir
    * shell
    * groups
    * Groups

- Boot admin
Allows you to set:

    * Default boot partition
    * Partition type and label
    * Timeout
    * Kernel image
    * Kernel extra parameters (append)
    * adding or deleting partitions from the boot manager

Backup system
=============
Every time a tool modifies your system configuration files, it makes backups of those files. The backups are rotated (for 9 levels in total), and the backup made the first time the tool was run is kept forever. This means that you can revert your system configuration to the point before you ever ran a GNOME System Tool.

The backup path is /var/cache/setup-tools-backends/backup/<tool>/<id>/. In this directory, you'll find a complete snapshot of the files that were modified. The original directory structure leading up to these files is also kept. <id> runs from 1-9, and when the first backup is rotated out, it is kept in a special catalog called "First", which is never touched again.

Current Tool Set
================
- Runlevel admin
Allows you to configure:
     * the services your computer will run at startup
     * in which runleves do they run

- Network admin
Allows you to configure your:

    * hostname
    * samba hostname and workgroup
    * DNS servers
    * search domains
    * hosts (/etc/hosts)
    * Network interfaces
    * ppp
    * ethernet
    * slip
    * wavelan (limited support)

- Time admin
Allows you to configure your:

    * Date & Time
    * Timezone
    * NTPD servers

- Users admin
Allows you to manage:

    * Users
    * username / full name
    * password
    * home dir
    * shell
    * groups
    * Groups

- Boot admin
Allows you to set:

    * Default boot partition
    * Partition type and label
    * Timeout
    * Kernel image
    * Kernel extra parameters (append)
    * adding or deleting partitions from the boot manager

The GNOME System Tools version 0.26.0 have been released.

The GNOME System Tools are a set of cross-platform configuration utilities for Linux and other Unix systems. Internally they are divided in frontends and backends. The frontend knows nothing about the underlying system and provides the same user interface across the different types of systems. The backend knows how to read and write the configuration information. The GNOME System Tools do not impose a new database on the system: they work with the default configuration files so that configuration can still be done by hand or by other tools.

Screenshots
===========
You can view screenshots of the most recent tools at http://www.gnome.org/projects/gst/screenshots.html

Changes since last release
==========================

  General
  =======
  - Added GST to pkgconfig, so any third party application could find backends
  
  Network
  =======
  - Added network profiles support (Garnacho)


  ... plus other lots of bugfixing (Garnacho, Carlos Garc√≠a)

  thanks to G√∂tz Waschk, Ken Stanley, James Livinston and Joseph Wenninger for sending patches

Downloading
===========
You can get it from : ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnome-system-tools

Help Wanted
===========
We still need lots of help from anybody interested in contributing to GST, even if it's only an email letting us know whether the tools worked for your system. You can also submit bug reports at http://bugzilla.gnome.org

Testing
-------
Testing that the tools work correctly on your system and either filing detailed bug reports or confirming that they work correctly is greatly appreciated. If you test a tool on an unsupported distro/system and find out that it works correctly, please let us know so that we can update the supported tools matrix (see below).

Porting
-------
The backends are designed as to minimize the effort needed to support more distros/systems. A great way to contribute is to port the tools to another distribution/system.

Prerequisites
=============

* GNOME 2 libraries

* GConf

* VTE

* gnome-print 

Stability
=========
The tools have been stable on our systems recently. However, since this tools modify your system configuration we suggest that only people which are going to be able to solve a problem if something goes wrong use them at the time. We have created a backup system so that the changes made to the configuration files are tracked and stored.

The GNOME System Tools version 0.21.0 have been released.

The GNOME System Tools are a set of cross-platform configuration utilities for Linux and other Unix systems. Internally they are divided in frontends and backends. The frontend knows nothing about the underlying system and provides the same user interface across the different types of systems. The backend knows how to read and write the configuration information. The GNOME System Tools do not impose a new database on the system: they work with the default configuration files so that configuration can still be done by hand or by other tools.

Screenshots
===========
You can view screenshots of the most recent tools at http://www.gnome.org/projects/gst/screenshots.html

Changes since last release
==========================

    * The project was ported to the GNOME 2.0 platform (Tambet, Garnacho, Chema)
    * Added Runlevel tool (Carlos Garnacho)
    * Bugfixing in the existing tools
    * New name
    * Ximian is not sponsoring GST (formerly XST, Ximian Setup Tools) anymore
    * Only the stable tools are enabled

Downloading
===========
You can get it from : ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/unstable/sources/gnome-system-tools/

Help Wanted
===========
We still need lots of help from anybody interested in contributing to GST, even if it's only an email letting us know whether the tools worked for your system. You can also submit bug reports at http://bugzilla.gnome.org

Testing
-------
Testing that the tools work correctly on your system and either filing detailed bug reports or confirming that they work correctly is greatly appreciated. If you test a tool on an unsupported distro/system and find out that it works correctly, please let us know so that we can update the supported tools matrix (see below).

Porting
-------
The backends are designed as to minimize the effort needed to support more distros/systems. A great way to contribute is to port the tools to another distribution/system.

Prerequisites
=============

* GNOME 2 libraries

* gal-2.0

* gnome-print 

Stability
=========
The tools have been stable on our systems recently. However, since this tools modify your system configuration we suggest that only people which are going to be able to solve a problem if something goes wrong use them at the time. We have created a backup system so that the changes made to the configuration files are tracked and stored.

Mailing list / IRC
==================
For discussion and feedback, sign up for our mailing list:http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/setup-tool-hackers

You can also find us in the #gst channel on IRC server irc.gnome.org

Whitepaper
==========
You can find the latest version of the GST whitepaper at: http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/helix-setup-tools.html

Backup system
=============
Every time a tool modifies your system configuration files, it makes backups of those files. The backups are rotated (for 9 levels in total), and the backup made the first time the tool was run is kept forever. This means that you can revert your system configuration to the point before you ever ran a Ximian Setup Tool.

The backup path is /var/cache/ximian-setup-tools/backup/<tool>/<id>/. In this directory, you'll find a complete snapshot of the files that were modified. The original directory structure leading up to these files is also kept. <id> runs from 1-9, and when the first backup is rotated out, it is kept in a special catalog called "First", which is never touched again.

Current Tool Set
================
- Runlevel admin
Allows you to configure:
     * the services your computer will run at startup
     * in which runleves do they run

- Network admin
Allows you to configure your:

    * hostname
    * samba hostname and workgroup
    * DNS servers
    * search domains
    * hosts (/etc/hosts)
    * Network interfaces
    * ppp
    * ethernet
    * slip
    * wavelan (limited support)

- Time admin
Allows you to configure your:

    * Date & Time
    * Timezone
    * NTPD servers

- Users admin
Allows you to manage:

    * Users
    * username / full name
    * password
    * home dir
    * shell
    * groups
    * Groups

- Boot admin
Allows you to set:

    * Default boot partition
    * Partition type and label
    * Timeout
    * Kernel image
    * Kernel extra parameters (append)
    * adding or deleting partitions from the boot manager

  version or distribution. Of course, there may still be bugs. :-)
  +? Supported, not tested. Same as '+', but we haven't tested it. In other
  words, it "should work", because we know it's compatible.
  ?  Unsupported, may work. You'll be asked to select a compatible version or
  distribution, which may or may not work.
  -  Unsupported, doesn't work. We haven't worked on any version of that
  flavour. It's most likely that it won't work.

XST - 0.10
==========
The Ximian Setup Tools 0.10.0 have been released.

The Ximian Setup Tools are a set of cross-platform configuration utilities
for Linux and other Unices. Internally they are divided in frontends and
backends. The frontend knows nothing about the underlying system and provides
the same user interface across the different types of systems. The backend
knows how to read and write configuration information. The Ximian Setup Tools
do not impose a new database on the system, they work with the default
configuration files so that configuration can still be done by hand or by
other tools. 


HELP Wanted !
-------------
We still need lots of help from anybody interested in contributing
to XST. Even if it only an email letting us know that the tools worked
fine in you system.

- Testing
   Testing that the tools work correctly on your system and either filing
   detailed bug reports or confirming that they work correctly is greatly
   appreciated. If you test a tool on an unsupported distro/system and find out
   that it works correctly let us know so that we can update the supported
   tools matrix (see below).
  
- Porting
   The backends are designed as to minimize the effort needed to support more
   distros/systems. A great way to contribute is to port the tools to
   another distribution/system.

Changes since last release
--------------------------

- Added Font tool.

- Added support for Red Hat 7.2

- Added support for Grub.

- Improved error reporting.

- Time now changes the clock when a timezone change is made and ntp state
  is loaded correctly.

- Lots of bugfixing in the existing tools.


Downloading
-----------
You can get it from :

ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/ximian-setup-tools

Mailing list / IRC
------------------

We have a mailing list set up at :
http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/setup-tool-hackers

You can also find us in IRC server irc.gnome.org channel #xst


Whitepaper
----------

You can find the latest version of the XST whitepaper at:

http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/helix-setup-tools.html


Backup system
-------------

Every time a tool modifies your system configuration files, it makes backups
of those files. The backups are rotated (for 9 levels in total), and the
backup made the first time the tool was run is kept forever. This means that
you can revert your system configuration to the point before you ever ran a
Ximian Setup Tool.

The backup path is /var/cache/ximian-setup-tools/backup/<tool>/<id>/. In this
directory, you'll find a complete snapshot of the files that were modified.
The original directory structure leading up to these files is also kept. <id>
runs from 1-9, and when the first backup is rotated out, it is kept in a
special catalog called "First", which is never touched again.


The current set of tools include :
----------------------------------

- Network admin
   
   Allows you to configure your:
   - hostname
   - samba hostname and workgroup
   - DNS servers
   - search domains

XST - 0.8
---------
The Ximian Setup Tools 0.8.0 have been released.

The Ximian Setup Tools are a set of cross-platform configuration utilities
for Linux and other Unices. Internally they are divided in frontends and
backends. The frontend knows nothing about the underlying system and provides
the same user interface across the different types of systems. The backend
knows how to read and write configuration information. The Ximian Setup Tools
do not impose a new database on the system, they work with the default
configuration files so that configuration can still be done by hand or by
other tools.

Changes since last release
--------------------------

- Added Display tool for configuring XFree86.

- Added Internet Sharing tool for easy sharing of an internet connection.

- Re-enabled the disabled Shares tool with many new features and
  improvements.

- Improved error reporting.

- Lots of stabilizing and bugfixing in the existing tools.


Downloading
----------
You can get it from :

ftp://ftp.ximian.com/pub/setuptools/
or (once the mirrors sync)
ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/ximian-setup-tools

Contributions
-------------

We are happy to say that a lot of contributions have started flowing
in. We still need lots of help from anybody interested in contributing
to XST. 

- Testing
   Testing that the tools work correctly on your system and either filing
   detailed bug reports or confirming that they work correctly is greatly
   appreciated. If you test a tool on an unsupported distro/system and find out
   that it works correctly let us know so that we can update the supported
   tools matrix (see below).
  
- Porting
   The backends are designed as to minimize the effort needed to support more
   distros/systems. A great way to contribute is to port the tools to
   another distribution/system.


Mailing list / IRC
------------------

We have a mailing list set up at :
http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/setup-tool-hackers

You can also find us in IRC server irc.gnome.org channel #xst


Whitepaper
----------

You can find the latest version of the XST whitepaper at:

http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/helix-setup-tools.html


Backup system
-------------

Every time a tool modifies your system configuration files, it makes backups
of those files. The backups are rotated (for 9 levels in total), and the
backup made the first time the tool was run is kept forever. This means that
you can revert your system configuration to the point before you ever ran a
Ximian Setup Tool.

The backup path is /var/cache/ximian-setup-tools/backup/<tool>/<id>/. In this
directory, you'll find a complete snapshot of the files that were modified.
The original directory structure leading up to these files is also kept. <id>
runs from 1-9, and when the first backup is rotated out, it is kept in a
special catalog called "First", which is never touched again.


The current set of tools include :
----------------------------------

- Network admin
   
   Allows you to configure your:
   - hostname
   - samba hostname and workgroup

Verification matrix
-------------------

This is a matrix describing the current status of tool platform/distribution
support, to the best of our knowledge.

Key:

+  Supported and tested. The tool will not ask you to select a compatible
   version or distribution. Of course, there may still be bugs. :-)
+? Supported, not tested. Same as '+', but we haven't tested it. In other
   words, it "should work", because we know it's compatible.
?  Unsupported, may work. You'll be asked to select a compatible version or
   distribution, which may or may not work.
-  Unsupported, doesn't work. We haven't worked on any version of that
   flavour. It's most likely that it won't work.

- This was a major bug fix release only. There are some internal changes but
no new user-visible features where added. We have started working on a new set
tools.

Location Management
-------------------

Location management is available under the program
"location-manager-capplet", now built by default.

This program runs in two modes: per-user and global. In per-user mode
(the default), the capplets available from the control center are
location-managed. In order to use this mode, you will need to fetch
the GNOME Control Center from CVS (HEAD branch). A release of the
Control Center with capplets that support location management will be
made shortly.

In global mode, the Ximian Setup Tools themselves are location
managed. To invoke the location manager in this mode, pass the -g
option. Of course, you will need to be running as root to run the
location manager in this mode.


The current set of tools include :
----------------------------------

- Network admin
   
   Allows you to configure your:
   - hostname
   - samba hostname and workgroup
   - DNS servers
   - search domains

XST - 0.5
---------

The Ximian Setup Tools 0.5.2, codenamed "Sorry Dude, We Like Codenames"
have been released.

The Ximian Setup Tools are a set of cross-platform configuration utilities
for Linux and other Unices. Internally they are divided in frontends and
backends. The frontend knows nothing about the underlying system and provides
the same user interface across the different types of systems. The backend
knows how to read and write configuration information. The Ximian Setup Tools
do not impose a new database on the system, they work with the default
configuration files so that configuration can still be done by hand or by
other tools.

Changes since last release
--------------------------

- Bugs bugs bugs. Too many to count (Everybody)
- New distros supported/testsed : Red Hat 7.1, SuSE 7.0
  Debian Woody (Arturo, Joakim, Chema) [*1]
- Added a debian dir (thanks hadess)
- Blinking removed from time tool (Hans Petter)
- User profiles in users tool (Tambet)
- Significant speedup (Hans Petter)
- Time-tool front end improvements (Chema)
- Timezone setting on Debian fixed (Hans Petter)
- All tools can save their state between sessions (Tambet)
- Searchbar is complexity-aware in users tool (Tambet)
- Sort list of selectable distributions (Nils Barth)
- Fixed shares tool SMB problems (Hans Petter)
- Location management builds by default now (Bradford)
- Beginnings of FreeBSD support (Theo van Klaveren)
- New root authentication based on work by Chris L. Bond (Hans Petter)
- You can now avoid having your DNS settings overriden with DHCP information
  with systems using pump (Arturo)
- Lots of strings marked for translation and typos corrected (Carlos)

[*1] - Debian Woody "mapping" stanzas for /etc/network/interfaces are not supported
yet. Modem and ISDN connections for SuSE 7.0 are not yet implemented as well.

Downloading
----------
You can get it from :

ftp://ftp.ximian.com/pub/setuptools/
or (once the mirrors sync)

Contributions
-------------

We are happy to say that a lot of contributions have started flowing
in. We still need lots of help from anybody interested in contributing
to XST. 

- Testing
   Testing that the tools work correctly on your system and either filing
   detailed bug reports or confirming that they work correctly is greatly
   appreciated. If you test a tool on an unsupported distro/system and find out
   that it works correctly let us know so that we can update the supported
   tools matrix (see below).
  
- Porting
   The backends are designed as to minimize the effort needed to support more
   distros/systems. A great way to contribute is to port the tools to
   another distribution/system.


Mailing list / IRC
------------------

We have a mailing list set up at :
http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/setup-tool-hackers

You can also find us in IRC server irc.gnome.org channel #xst


Whitepaper
----------

You can find the latest version of the XST whitepaper at:

http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/helix-setup-tools.html


Backup system
-------------

Every time a tool modifies your system configuration files, it makes backups
of those files. The backups are rotated (for 9 levels in total), and the
backup made the first time the tool was run is kept forever. This means that
you can revert your system configuration to the point before you ever ran a
Ximian Setup Tool.

The backup path is /var/cache/ximian-setup-tools/backup/<tool>/<id>/. In this
directory, you'll find a complete snapshot of the files that were modified.
The original directory structure leading up to these files is also kept. <id>
runs from 1-9, and when the first backup is rotated out, it is kept in a
special catalog called "First", which is never touched again.
     
Location Management
-------------------

Location management is available under the program
"location-manager-capplet", now built by default.

This program runs in two modes: per-user and global. In per-user mode
(the default), the capplets available from the control center are
location-managed. In order to use this mode, you will need to fetch
the GNOME Control Center from CVS (HEAD branch). A release of the
Control Center with capplets that support location management will be
made shortly.

In global mode, the Ximian Setup Tools themselves are location
managed. To invoke the location manager in this mode, pass the -g
option. Of course, you will need to be running as root to run the
location manager in this mode.


The current set of tools include :
----------------------------------

- Network admin
   
   Allows you to configure your:
   - hostname
   - samba hostname and workgroup
   - DNS servers
   - search domains
   - hosts (/etc/hosts)
   - Network interfaces
        - ppp 
        - ethernet
        - slip
        - wavelan (limited support)

Verification matrix
-------------------

This is a matrix describing the current status of tool platform/distribution
support. To the best of our knowledge.

Key:

+  Supported and tested. The tool will not ask you to select a compatible
   version or distribution. Of course, there may still be bugs. :-)
+? Supported, not tested. Same as '+', but we haven't tested it. In other
   words, it "should work", because we know it's compatible.
?  Unsupported, may work. You'll be asked to select a compatible version or
   distribution, which may or may not work.
-  Unsupported, doesn't work. We haven't worked on any version of that
   flavour. It's most possible that it won't work.

===========================================================================================
XST - 0.3
---------

The Ximian Setup Tools 0.3.0
codenamed : "They know what is what but they don't know what is what"
have been released.

You can get it here :
ftp://ftp.ximian.com/pub/setuptools/ximian-setup-tools-0.3.0.tar.gz

This is a working snapshot of a continuous effort, and the project is still
in its infancy. As such, there are no guarantees of usability, beauty or evil
masterplan compliance. Although we've made an effort to iron out all the
bugs, the tools may still damage your system configuration. For that reason,
we've created a backup system for your config files (see below).

This is a new features and beautification release. Most of the tools have new
artwork, courtesy of Tuomas and Jakub, and some have new interfaces by Anna.
Also, there is lots of new code.

Ximian Setup Tools now require, in addition to the GNOME libraries, the
latest version of GAL. You should get by with GAL 0.5, but the latest CVS
snapshot is recommended.


Tools in this release
---------------------

Boot     LILO boot parameters. Beautified.
Disks    Find local harddisk partitions and mount them. Not beautified.
Memory   Swap partitions and files. Not beautified.
Network  All kinds of network parameters. Multiple interfaces. Beautified.
Shares   NFS, SMB. Export, detect, import. Not beautified.
Time     System clock, timezone, timeserver synchronization. Beautified.
Users    Users and groups. Beautified.


Participation
-------------

We need help, in particular to test these tools and port them to as many
Unixy platforms and distributions as possible.

If this seems like a worthy challenge, please get in touch with us. Further
information can be found in the references section at the end of this text.

Also, if you have any problems with these tools (identified in detail or
not), we'd be absolutely delighted to hear from you.



Backup system
-------------

Every time a tool modifies your system configuration files, it makes backups
of those files. The backups are rotated (for 9 levels in total), and the
backup made the first time the tool was run is kept forever. This means that
you can revert your system configuration to the point before you ever ran a
Ximian Setup Tool.

The backup path is /var/cache/ximian-setup-tools/backup/<tool>/<id>/. In this
directory, you'll find a complete snapshot of the files that were modified.
The original directory structure leading up to these files is also kept. <id>
runs from 1-9, and when the first backup is rotated out, it is kept in a
special catalog called "First", which is never touched again.


Changes since 0.2.1
-------------------

- Time beautified (Anna, Jacob).

- Time backend speedup (Chema).

- Added report display to frontend, which shows actions taken as
  configuration is read/written (Hans Petter).

- Source cleanup (Jacob).

- Backend code refactored (Hans Petter).

- Networking and Name Resolution merged to form new, pretty and more
  functional Network (Jacob, Arturo, Anna, Chema).

- Users fixed and polished (Tambet).

- Implemented Boot tool (Tambet).

- Platform detection and selection (Arturo, Hans Petter).

- New configuration backup/rescue scheme (Hans Petter).

- Generic code for parsing/modifying configuration files (Arturo).

- Countless bugfixes (everyone).


About the Ximian Setup Tools
----------------------------

- Primary audience - desktop users:

  These tools are intended to simplify the tasks of configuring a Unix system
  for workstations. They are not intended for configuring Unix servers.

- Unified system configuration:

  Configuring different Unix systems is different; every Unix system has
  different ways of being administrated. The Ximian Setup Tools aspire to
  unify handling of these systems.

- Adaptability:

  Each one of the Ximian Setup Tools is split in two parts: a backend (which
  is typically written in Perl) and a user interface frontend (which is
  typically written in C or Python).

  The backends are written in a way that should allow us to quickly adapt
  them to different flavors of Unix; the backend probes your system and
  parses the existing system files. When the user has finished editing the
  settings, the configuration is written back as patches to the system files.

  This means that the Ximian Setup Tools use whatever configuration files are
  available on your system, and you can still edit those files by hand or
  with other configuration tools without conflicts.

Supported platforms/linux distributions
---------------------------------------
This is the list of platforms that Ximian will focus to support. The XST are
a community effort so in no way is this list limiting the supported systems.
Contributions to the XST for support of other distributions or UNIX variants
is very much appreciated.

Please note that the following list is NOT a list of supported
distributions, but rather a list of distributions we are planning to
support.

REDHAT   - Red Hat Linux 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, and 7.0 
DEBIAN   - Debian GNU/Linux (Woody and Potato) 
SUSE     - SuSE 6.3, 6.4, and 7.0 
MANDRAKE - Linux Mandrake 6.1 and 7.0 
PPC      - LinuxPPC 2000
TURBO    - TurboLinux 6.0 
CALDERA  - Caldera OpenLinux eDesktop 2.4 
YELLOW   - Yellow Dog Linux Champion Server 1.2 el
SOLARIS  - Solaris 7 and 8 on UltraSparc 
HPUX     - HP-UX

Release of 0.2.1 (Suspicion breeds Confidence)
==============================================

- Ability to change users' passwords in Users, even with MD5 enabled.
  [Arturo, Tambet]

- Debian adaption for Name Resolution backend. [Michael Vogt]

- Fixes to build system. [Mathieu Lacage]

- Aesthetic improvements to EMap, used for timezone selection in Time.
  [Hans Petter]

- Wrote and added README, NEWS, AUTHORS and HACKING files to the
  distribution. [Hans Petter]

- Made Users XML handling more robust. [Tambet]

- Fixed problem arising when Users backend got empty logindefs keys, which
  lead to some crashes. [Young-Ho Cha]

- More intuitive IP entry in Networking. [Peter Hawkins]

- Massive translation work. [The GNOME translation team]

- I18n enabled in all frontends, shortcoming pointed out by Robert Vanyi.
  [Hans Petter]

- Graphical root authentication when started from GNOME panel menu, works
  through Red Hat's consolehelper. [Hans Petter]


Release of 0.2.0 (Un-ix)
========================

- Merged the existing tools into one package with shared, policy-enforcing
  code for the frontends. [Hans Petter]

- Shared Perl code for backends and a cleanup of existing Perl code. [Arturo]

- Implemented Time. [Hans Petter]

- Implemented Memory. [Bradford]

- Implemented Disks. [Hans Petter]

- Implemented Users. [Arturo, Tambet]

- Re-implemented parts of Memory to make the backend do all the config
  detection and manipulation. [Tambet]

- Simple protocol that allows the backends to tell the frontends about their
  progress, and progress indicators in all frontends. [Hans Petter]

- Handling of fstab is more gentle, preserving all manually set options,
  e.g. NFS' wsize, rsize. [Hans Petter]

- Integration with the new control-center. At this point, you need CVS
  control-center to make it work, but the icons show up in the old one as
  well. [Bradford, Hans Petter]

- Shares has more robust handling of user input. [Hans Petter]

- Totally reworked the timezone selector in the early release of Time. It now
  has locations instead of GMT offset strips, uses GdkPixbuf directly (faster
  and better-looking), and has some special effects. All of this is in a
  reusable widget called EMap and a surrogate widget-like layer called
  ETzMap. [Hans Petter]

- Debian support for Networking. [David Lee Ludwig]

- Shares now has more workarounds for pessimal SMB situations, like Windows
  master hosts that serve empty host lists (in error). [Hans Petter]

- Build-time massaging of interfaces and backends that makes life both
  easier and more conforming. [Arturo]

- Red Hat 7.0 fixes. [Hans Petter]
