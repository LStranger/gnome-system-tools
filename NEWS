Release of 0.3.0 (They know what is what but they don't know what is what)
==========================================================================

The Ximian Setup Tools 0.3.0, aka "Charm / 10", are out.

ftp://ftp.ximian.com/pub/setuptools/ximian-setup-tools-0.3.0.tar.gz

This is a working snapshot of a continuous effort, and the project is still
in its infancy. As such, there are no guarantees of usability, beauty or
evil masterplan compliance.

This is a new features and beautification release. Most of the tools have new
artwork, courtesy of Tuomas and Jakub, and some have new interfaces by Anna.
Also, there is lots of new code.

Ximian Setup Tools now require, in addition to the GNOME libraries, the
latest version of GAL. You should get by with GAL 0.5, but the latest CVS
snapshot is recommended.


Tools in this release
---------------------

Boot     LILO boot parameters. Beautified.
Disks    Find local harddisk partitions and mount them. Not beautified.
Memory   Swap partitions and files. Not beautified.
Network  All kinds of network parameters. Multiple interfaces. Beautified.
Shares   NFS, SMB. Export, detect, import. Not beautified.
Time     System clock, timezone, timeserver synchronization. Beautified.
Users    Users and groups. Beautified.


Participation
-------------

We need help, in particular to test these tools and port them to as many
Unixy platforms and distributions as possible.

If this seems like a worthy challenge, please get in touch with us. Further
information can be found in the references section at the end of this text.

Also, if you have any problems with these tools (identified in detail or
not), we'd be absolutely delighted to hear from you.

- Networking and Name Resolution merged to form new, pretty and more
  functional Network (Jacob, Arturo, Anna, Chema).

- Users fixed and polished (Tambet).

- Implemented Boot tool (Tambet).

- Platform detection and selection (Arturo, Hans Petter).

- New configuration backup/rescue scheme (Hans Petter).

About the Ximian Setup Tools
----------------------------

- Primary audience - desktop users:

  These tools are intended to simplify the tasks of configuring a Unix system
  for workstations. They are not intended for configuring Unix servers.

- Unified system configuration:

  Configuring different Unix systems is different; every Unix system has
  different ways of being administrated. The Helix Setup Tools aspire to
  unify handling of these systems.

- Adaptability:

  Each one of the Helix Setup Tools is split in two parts: a backend (which
  is typically written in Perl) and a user interface frontend (which is
  typically written in C or Python).

  The backends are written in a way that should allow us to quickly adapt
  them to different flavors of Unix; the backend probes your system and
  parses the existing system files. When the user has finished editing the
  settings, the configuration is written back as patches to the system files.

  This means that the Helix Setup Tools use whatever configuration files are
  available on your system, and you can still edit those files by hand or
  with other configuration tools without conflicts or data loss.

Release of 0.2.1 (Suspicion breeds Confidence)
==============================================

- Ability to change users' passwords in Users, even with MD5 enabled.
  [Arturo, Tambet]

- Debian adaption for Name Resolution backend. [Michael Vogt]

- Fixes to build system. [Mathieu Lacage]

- Aesthetic improvements to EMap, used for timezone selection in Time.
  [Hans Petter]

- Wrote and added README, NEWS, AUTHORS and HACKING files to the
  distribution. [Hans Petter]

- Made Users XML handling more robust. [Tambet]

- Fixed problem arising when Users backend got empty logindefs keys, which
  lead to some crashes. [Young-Ho Cha]

- More intuitive IP entry in Networking. [Peter Hawkins]

- Massive translation work. [The GNOME translation team]

- I18n enabled in all frontends, shortcoming pointed out by Robert Vanyi.
  [Hans Petter]

- Graphical root authentication when started from GNOME panel menu, works
  through Red Hat's consolehelper. [Hans Petter]


Release of 0.2.0 (Un-ix)
========================

- Merged the existing tools into one package with shared, policy-enforcing
  code for the frontends. [Hans Petter]

- Shared Perl code for backends and a cleanup of existing Perl code. [Arturo]

- Implemented Time. [Hans Petter]

- Implemented Memory. [Bradford]

- Implemented Disks. [Hans Petter]

- Implemented Users. [Arturo, Tambet]

- Re-implemented parts of Memory to make the backend do all the config
  detection and manipulation. [Tambet]

- Simple protocol that allows the backends to tell the frontends about their
  progress, and progress indicators in all frontends. [Hans Petter]

- Handling of fstab is more gentle, preserving all manually set options,
  e.g. NFS' wsize, rsize. [Hans Petter]

- Integration with the new control-center. At this point, you need CVS
  control-center to make it work, but the icons show up in the old one as
  well. [Bradford, Hans Petter]

- Shares has more robust handling of user input. [Hans Petter]

- Totally reworked the timezone selector in the early release of Time. It now
  has locations instead of GMT offset strips, uses GdkPixbuf directly (faster
  and better-looking), and has some special effects. All of this is in a
  reusable widget called EMap and a surrogate widget-like layer called
  ETzMap. [Hans Petter]

- Debian support for Networking. [David Lee Ludwig]

- Shares now has more workarounds for pessimal SMB situations, like Windows
  master hosts that serve empty host lists (in error). [Hans Petter]

- Build-time massaging of interfaces and backends that makes life both
  easier and more conforming. [Arturo]

- Red Hat 7.0 fixes. [Hans Petter]
